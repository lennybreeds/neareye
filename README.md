NearEye aims to enhance internet safety by using transformer models and community knowledge to detect and prevent scams.

Website Safety Checks: NearEye employs a Chrome extension to assess website safety in real time. When a user visits a website, information such as the URL, site content, JavaScript code, and domain age is analyzed by a transformer model. This model generates a safety rating between 0 and 1 and reasons for potential safety concerns. These findings are displayed to the user through a bannerâ€”green indicating safety and red indicating potential danger. The extension also allows users to see a detailed safety percentage and the reasons categorized under URL, site content, JavaScript code, and domain age. Visited websites are added to a blockchain-based whitelist or blacklist, enhancing future assessment speed by referencing these lists instead of re-evaluating websites.

Community Voting: Users can challenge website classifications via community voting, influencing whether a site should be moved between the whitelist and blacklist. Initiating a vote requires tokens, with costs varying according to the website's initial safety rating. This cost mechanism is designed to equalize the expense of voting regardless of the site's safety rating. Votes last 24 hours, plus one second for each token spent voting. The outcome depends on the majority vote, with tokens from the losing side being distributed among successful voters, retained for profit, or burned. This system rewards positive contributions while penalizing misuse, thereby enhancing trust. Repeat voting on a website matches the token amount from the last winning vote.

Token Distribution: Tokens are allocated as follows: 40% to the community and ecosystem (with significant portions for trusted members), 10% to marketing and partnerships, 15% each to research and development, and the foundation reserve, with the remaining 20% for the team and advisors. This strategy aims to ensure the system's trustworthiness and community safety.

Future Developments: The transformer model will continuously improve through training on community vote outcomes, aligning more closely with community standards and enhancing its predictive accuracy.
NearEye uses a Chrome extension and transformer models to rate internet safety, analyzing URLs, content, and code to warn users of risks via color-coded banners. Websites are stored on a blockchain-based whitelist or blacklist, speeding up future checks. Users can vote to reclassify websites, with voting costs based on the site's safety rating and tokens used in voting influencing the vote's duration. Tokens are distributed across the community, R&D, marketing, and the team to ensure system integrity. Future improvements include refining the model with vote outcomes to better align with community judgments, enhancing its predictive accuracy.
